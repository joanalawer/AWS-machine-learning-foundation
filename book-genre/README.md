# 1. book-genre-exploration
This project is the second from the AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree Program.

This is an unsupervised machine larning.

The project originally used a clustering technique; Bag of Words model, to identify genre of books based on the books description.

On this project I try to use all available models possible to reach the same onjective and also understand how these differnet models affect the resulting outcome.
