## Exercise: Upload to PyPi

In this part of the lesson, you'll practice uploading a package to PyPi.

In the Supporting materials section of this page, there is a zip file called 5_exercise_upload_to_pypi.zip . Download and unzip this file.

The Python package is located in the folder 5_exercise_upload_to_pypi.

You need to create three files:

setup.cfg
README.md
license.txt

You also need to create accounts for the pypi test repository and pypi repository.

Don't forget to keep your passwords; you'll need to type them into the command line.

Once you have all the files set up correctly, you can use the following commands on the command line. You need to make the name of the package unique, so change the name of the package from distributions to something else. That means changing the information in setup.py and the folder name.

In the terminal, make sure you are in the 5_exercise_upload_to_pypi directory. If not, navigate there by entering the following at the command line:


### cd 5_exercise_upload_to_pypi

### python setup.py sdist

### pip install twine

Commands to upload to the PyPi test repository

twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ distributions


Command to upload to the PyPi repository

### twine upload dist/*

### pip install distributions
